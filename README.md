# Toxic-Comment-Detection-with-DistilBERT-Attention-Based-Explainability
Developed a multi-label toxic comment detection system using DistilBERT, fine-tuned on over 160,000 online comments to classify six categories of toxicity with F1 scores exceeding 0.83. Optimized performance through focal loss, early stopping, and per-label threshold tuning based on validation F1 maximization. Deployed model in an interactive Gradio web application featuring instant predictions and attention-based interpretability, allowing users to see which words influenced modelâ€™s decisions. Enables real-time content moderation, promoting safer online interactions and offering scalable, interpretable tool for managing user-generated content.
